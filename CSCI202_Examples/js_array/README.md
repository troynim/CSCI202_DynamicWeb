Design Exercise: Rewrite the story about Mary and her fruit. 

1. For example one, make the number of fruit that Mary eats into a variable.

2. For example two, use a for loop that involves the arrays of fruit.  

3. If you have time, for example two, use the push() method so Mary can buy more fruit from the farmers market. And use an if statement to evaluate the quality of a fruit before purchasing.
